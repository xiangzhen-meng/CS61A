# CS61A Self-Study Repository

This repository documents my self-study of [**UC Berkeley CS61A: Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs**](https://cs61a.org/).

It contains my completed labs, homework etc., organized as a long-term learning archive.

The study plan and resource selection are largely inspired by [**csdiy.wiki**](https://csdiy.wiki/), which provides a structured and rigorous roadmap for independent computer science study.

As of now, my self-study of **CS61A has been completed**. All major coursework components have been finished, and the repository materials are largely complete. 

If you find this repository useful as a learning reference, feel free to explore it critically.
